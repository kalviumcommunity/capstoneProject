# Database
This code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, a popular ODM for Node.js.

The connectDB function uses mongoose.connect() to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster with a given connection string.

The async function ensures that the connection attempt is handled properly, and .then() logs a success message if the connection is established.

The connection string contains the database credentials, including the username, password, and cluster information.

This approach allows seamless database interaction in Node.js applications, making it easy to store and retrieve data.

# schema creation
Here there are some points about schema.
Structure Definition: A schema defines the structure of data â€” including tables, fields, and data types in a database.

Validation Rules: It enforces rules like required fields, data formats (e.g., strings, integers), and constraints (like unique or foreign keys).

Relationship Mapping: In relational databases, schemas describe relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

Documentation Tool: Schemas act as a blueprint or documentation for developers to understand the shape and requirements of data.

Used in APIs & ORMs: In APIs (like GraphQL or REST with JSON Schema) and ORMs (like Mongoose for MongoDB), schemas validate and model data before storing or transmitting it.
